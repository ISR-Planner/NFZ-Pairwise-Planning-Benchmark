"""Opportunistic refueling — solver-decided refuel plan.

Replaces the prescriptive forced-leg model (refuel_stops -> fixed virtual legs).
Here the user designates which refuel points a drone MAY use (refuel_options) and
a max-refuel cap; THIS module decides whether/when/where/how-many times to refuel
to maximize collected points.

Model (validated in scripts/opp_refuel_prototype.py): the drone alternates
between BASES (refuel points = start airport + compatible airports + tankers). At
a base it has a full tank. It flies a SORTIE (base -> targets -> same base) within
budget, refuels (counts vs max_refuels), and may sortie again from the same base
OR transit to another base. It ends at a real airport. A sortie that earns no
target is dominated (never taken) — so no pointless refuels, no empty sorties.

Each sortie / transit / final leg is solved by the EXISTING Held-Karp solver via a
`leg_solver` callback (so SAM-aware distances + optimal in-leg ordering are reused;
no brute force). This module only chooses the refuel STRUCTURE.

        refuel_options: ids the drone MAY refuel at (bases) — airports + tankers,
            already runway-filtered by the caller. May include `start`.
        tanker_ids: which option ids are tankers (never an endpoint).
        target_ids: target ids assigned to this drone.
        target_priority: id -> priority points.
        budget: tank (km) — full after every refuel. On a fresh solve this is also
            the leg-1 fuel; on a replan, leg 1 uses `start_budget` instead.
        start_budget: leg-1 fuel (km) available at `start`. Defaults to `budget`
            (fresh solve = full tank). On a dynamic replan the drone has already
            burned part of its tank, so leg 1 flies on this REDUCED fuel while every
            post-refuel leg still gets the full `budget`. Without this split the DFS
            capped EVERY leg at the reduced fuel, so after a deep cut only one nearby
            target fit even though a refuel would restore the full tank — the drone
            parked at the first post-cut target instead of finishing the mission.
        max_refuels: cap on refuels (0 = no refuel allowed).
        leg_solver: callback to solve one leg with the real Held-Karp solver.
        valid_end_airports: real airports the drone may END at (runway-filtered).

    Returns dict: {route, visited_targets, distance, refuel_indices, leg_distances,
                   points}. `route` includes start, every refuel/target waypoint,

    # already filtered to real refuel nodes.
    #
    # `start` is NOT automatically a base. On a fresh solve `start` is a real airport
