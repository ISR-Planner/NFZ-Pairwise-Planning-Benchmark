"""Virtual-drone expansion for multi-stop refueling.

A refuel stop is a fixed airport that splits a physical drone into LEGS; each leg
is treated as a first-class "virtual drone" with its own start/end airport. The
existing allocate -> Held-Karp -> optimize pipeline then handles the legs as if
they were just more drones (no greedy, no special two-leg solver). After solving,
the legs are merged back into one physical-drone route.

Virtual-drone id format: "{parent}_L{n}", 1-based leg number. A drone with no
refuel stops is NOT expanded — it stays under its own id (single leg).

Fuel (§11.10): every leg gets a FULL TANK (fuel_budget) because a refuel tops it
up. The FIRST leg of a dynamic replan inherits the physical drone's transient
`start_fuel` (the reduced remaining); later legs always get the full tank.
